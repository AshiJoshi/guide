## Article Tag

The `<article>` tag represents self-contained content in a document. The article should be independent from the rest of page, intended to be distributable and reusable.

The `<article>` must make sense on it's own. Also, it must be possible to interpret it independantly from the website it is taken from.

The `<article>` tag was added in HTML5 and is supported by major browsers.

It can be used for various purposes like News Stories on website, Blog Posts, etc.

### Example

```html

  <h1>FreeCodeCamp</h1>
  <p>
    Learn to code with a community of programmers and contribute to open source projects.
  </p>
